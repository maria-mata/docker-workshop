# Docker Workshop Instructions

For any exercises that involve vocabulary or answer questions, actually write out full answers to them. It's very difficult to wrestle many of these ideas into words!

## Session 1

1. Read the content in [Docker Intro](docker-intro/)
  * Then, do the [exercise](docker-intro/exercises.md)
  * Then try to write definitions to each term in the [vocab list](docker-intro/vocabulary.md).
  * Then try to answer each of the [questions](docker-intro/questions.md). They may require additional reading and research.
2. Read the content in [YAML](yaml/)
  * Then, do the [exercises](yaml/exercises.md)
  * Then try to write definitions to each term in the [vocab list](docker-intro/vocabulary.md).
  * Then try to answer each of the [questions](yaml/questions.md).
3. Read the content in [Docker Compose](docker-compose-1/)
  * Then, do the [exercise](docker-compose/exercises.md)
  * Then try to write definitions to each term in the [vocab list](docker-compose/vocabulary.md).
  * Then try to answer each of the [questions](docker-compose/questions.md).
