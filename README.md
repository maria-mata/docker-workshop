  * Then, do the [exercise](docker-intro/exercises.md)
  * Then try to write definitions to each term in the [vocab list](docker-intro/vocabulary.md).
  * Then try to answer each of the [questions](docker-intro/questions.md). They may require additional reading and research.
2. Read the content in [YAML](yaml/)
  * Then, do the [exercises](yaml/exercises.md)
