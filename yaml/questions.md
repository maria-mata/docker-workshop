* What is a data serialization format?
    - A standard for storing and transporting data that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
* Why does data need to be serialized?
    - Data needs to be converted to a stream of bytes in order to store it in memory or in a file
* What's the difference between a list and a collection in YAML?
    - Items in a collection have labels, whereas items in a list are unlabeled.
* What distinguishes YAML from other data serialization formats such as XML and JSON?
    - YAML is a superset of JSON so technically all JSON is valid YAML, but not the other way around.
    - XML is meant to be a markup language, whereas YAML is a data format.
